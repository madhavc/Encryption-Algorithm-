Encryption-Algorithm-
=====================
The following program is a implementation of a encryption algorithm which outputs the encrypted integer. Use integer variables for input (no character string, no arrays).

Algorithm:
	(a) Replace each digit i by (i+7) mod 10.
	(b) Swap the 1st digit with the 3rd and swap the 2nd digit with the 4th.

For instance,
	given data = 1009,
	after step (a) → 8776,
	after step (b) → 7687. 

A sample input/output test run may look like:

	Please enter a 4-digit integer:		1009
	The encrypted integer for 1009 is:		7687
